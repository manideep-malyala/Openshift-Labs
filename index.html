              <p>OpenShift is a container orchestration platform that makes it easier to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. It provides a set of tools and APIs that allow you to define and manage your applications in a declarative way, using concepts such as pods, services, and deployments. OpenShift also includes built-in support for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), which makes it easier to automate the build, test, and deployment process for your applications.</p>
              <p>In addition to its core container orchestration capabilities, OpenShift also provides a range of additional features and tools that can help you manage your applications more effectively. These include features such as role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions, support for multiple programming languages and frameworks, and integration with popular development tools such as Jenkins and GitLab. Whether you are a developer building applications for the cloud, or an IT manager looking to improve your organization's software delivery processes, OpenShift can provide a powerful and flexible platform for building and deploying containerized applications.</p>
